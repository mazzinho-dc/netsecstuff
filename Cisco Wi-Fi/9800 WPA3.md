# WPA3 on Cisco 9800

#### Intro
- WPA3 leverages **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)** to provide stronger protections for users against password guessing attempts by third parties
- **Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)** provides encryption of the wireless medium. The OWE uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithms based Cryptography to setup the wireless encryption. With OWE, the client and AP perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange during the access procedure and use the resulting pairwise secret with the 4-way handshake. The use of OWE enhances wireless network security for deployments where Open or shared PSK based networks are deployed.

## Configuring SAE (WPA3+WPA2 Mixed Mode)

#### CLI
```Cisco
wlan WPA3-PSK-SAE 1 WPA3-PSK-SAE
no security wpa akm dot1x
no security ft over-the-ds
no security ft
security wpa wpa2 ciphers aes
security wpa psk set-key ascii 0 Cisco123
security wpa wpa3
security wpa akm sae
security wpa akm psk
no shutdown
```

## Configuring WPA3 Enterprise
```Cisco
wlan WPA3-dot1x 4 WPA3-dot1x
no security wpa akm dot1x
no security wpa wpa2
security wpa akm dot1x-sha256
security wpa wpa3
security dot1x authentication-list ipv6_ircm_aaa_list
no shutdown
```

## Configuring the WPA3 OWE
```
Before you begin Configure PMF internally. The associated ciphers configuration can use the WPA2 ciphers.
```

```cisco
wlan WPA3-OWE 2 WPA3-OWE
no security ft over-the-ds
no security ft
no security wpa akm dot1x
no security wpa wpa2
security wpa wpa2 ciphers aes
security wpa akm owe
no shutdown
```

#### OWE Transition Mode
Konfiguration einer WPA3 OWE SSID, kein SSID Broadcast 
und einer Open SSID OWE Transition, SSID Broadcast.

```Cisco
!Hidden WPA3 OWE SSID
wlan WPA3-OWE-Transition 7 WPA3-OWE-Transition
	no broadcast-ssid
	dot11bg 11g
	no security ft adaptive
	no security wpa wpa2
	no security wpa akm dot1x
	security wpa akm owe
	security wpa transition-mode-wlan-id 8
	security wpa wpa3
	security pmf mandatory
	no shutdown
```

```Cisco
!Offene SSID
wlan Guest 8 Guest
	dot11bg 11g
	no security ft adaptive
	no security wpa
	no security wpa wpa2
	no security wpa wpa2 ciphers aes
	no security wpa akm dot1x
	security wpa transition-mode-wlan-id 7
	no shutdown
```
